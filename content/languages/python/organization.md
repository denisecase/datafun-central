This page provides an overview of the fundamental building blocks of Python code organization:

### Variable

A variable is a named memory location that holds a value.

### Expression

An expression is a combination of operators (e.g. +) and operands (e.g. 1 or age) that resolves to a value.

### Statement

A statement is the smallest unit of a Python script. All scripts are made up of statements. Some statements are expressions, while others are not (e.g. print("hello")).

### Function

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help to break up large programs into smaller, more manageable pieces, and can be reused across different parts of a program or across different programs.

### Class

A class is a blueprint for creating objects in Python. Classes define the attributes (data fields) and methods (functions) that all objects of a certain type will have. Using classes, we can create multiple instances (objects) of a certain type, each with their own unique attributes.

In Python, classes are optional, but many modules use an object-oriented approach to organizing code. 

### Object

An object is a specific instance of a class that holds real data. For example, if we have a `Dog` class, we can create two objects, `sam = Dog("Sam", 3)` and `fido = Dog("Fido", 4)`, each with their own name and age attributes.

### File / Module

In Python, a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. Each .py file is a Python script and, by definition, a Python file is also a module. The name of the module is the same as the name of the file, without the .py extension.

### Package

A package is a way of organizing related modules together. Packages allow us to group together related functionality in a way that is easy to import and use. A package is simply a directory that contains one or more Python modules.

### Library

A library is a collection of packages and modules that provides a set of pre-written code for specific tasks. The Python Standard Library is a large collection of libraries that are included with Python and provide a wide range of functionality, from file input/output to regular expressions to networking.

Overall, understanding these fundamental building blocks of Python organization is essential for writing clean, well-structured code that is easy to read, maintain, and reuse.
