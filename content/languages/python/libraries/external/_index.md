Python has a vast ecosystem of external libraries for data analytics, visualization, and statistical processing. Here are some of the most popular and widely used libraries:

## NumPy

NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, along with tools for working with these arrays. NumPy is widely used in scientific computing and data analysis, and is the foundation for many other Python libraries.

## pandas

pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides a high-performance DataFrame object for working with structured data, and includes tools for data cleaning, merging, and reshaping. pandas is widely used in data science and machine learning, and is a key component of the PyData ecosystem.

## Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides a wide range of plotting tools and options, and can create a variety of charts, plots, and graphs. Matplotlib is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning.

## Seaborn

Seaborn is a library for creating statistical visualizations in Python. It provides a high-level interface for creating a variety of statistical charts, plots, and graphs, including heatmaps, bar plots, and scatter plots. Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and integrates well with pandas data structures.

## Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn is a library for machine learning in Python. It provides tools for data preprocessing, feature selection, model selection, and evaluation, and includes a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. Scikit-learn is widely used in data science and machine learning, and is the foundation for many other Python machine learning libraries.

## TensorFlow

TensorFlow is a library for machine learning and deep learning in Python. It provides tools for building and training deep neural networks, and includes a wide range of pre-built models for image recognition, natural language processing, and more. TensorFlow is widely used in artificial intelligence, data science, and machine learning.

## PyTorch

PyTorch is a library for machine learning and deep learning in Python. It provides tools for building and training deep neural networks, and includes a wide range of pre-built models for image recognition, natural language processing, and more. PyTorch is known for its dynamic computational graph, which enables flexible and efficient model building.

## More

These are just a few of the many external libraries available for data analytics, visualization, and statistical processing in Python. 

Each library has its own strengths and use cases, so it's important to know enough about the major options to be able to choose the right tool for the job.
