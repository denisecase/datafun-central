Python comes with a vast library of modules that are included in any installation of Python, known as the Python Standard Library. 

These modules offer a wide range of functionality that can be used for various tasks such as working with data, networking, file handling, and much more. 

Here is a brief introduction to some of the commonly used modules in the Python Standard Library:

## os

This module provides a way of interacting with the operating system, allowing you to access system files and directories, work with environment variables, and much more.

## sys

This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. It allows you to manipulate the Python runtime environment and perform system-specific operations.

## datetime

This module provides classes for working with dates and times. It allows you to create, manipulate, and format dates and times and perform calculations with them.

## math

This module provides mathematical functions such as trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, and many others. It also includes constants such as pi and e.

## random

This module provides functions for generating pseudo-random numbers. It can be used for simulating random events, creating games, and much more.

## re

This module provides support for regular expressions, a powerful tool for text processing. It allows you to search for patterns in text, extract specific parts of text, and perform various operations on text.

## urllib

This module provides a high-level interface for working with URLs and URIs. It allows you to retrieve data from web pages, download files, and much more.

## json

This module provides support for working with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a lightweight data interchange format. It allows you to encode and decode JSON data, convert JSON data to Python objects, and vice versa.

## argparse

This module provides a way of creating command-line interfaces. It allows you to specify arguments and options for your program and provides help messages and error handling.

## Years of Experience

For the most part, teams assume analysts can master basic Python syntax in a matter of weeks.

It's learning and using the vast array of libraries available that can take many years of experience. 

Learning how to use this freely available code can be very valuable.
