A Python **script** is a file containing Python code that can be executed by the Python interpreter. 

Scripts can be used to automate tasks, perform calculations, or interact with other software systems.

## Run A Script

To run a Python script, 
you need to have the Python interpreter installed on your system. 
Once you have installed Python, 
you can run a script by opening a terminal or command prompt, 
navigating to the directory containing the script, 
and typing `python myscript.py` (replacing `myscript` with the name of your script).

For example, if you have a script named `myscript.py` in a 
directory called `myproject`, you can run it by opening a terminal or command prompt, 
navigating to the `myproject` directory, and typing `python myscript.py`.

If your script requires any **command-line arguments**, 
you can pass them to the script by including them after the script name. 
For example, if your script requires a filename as an argument, 
you could run it like this: `python myscript.py myfile.txt`.

When you run a Python script, the interpreter reads the code 
in the file and executes it.
Any output produced by the script is printed to the console.
