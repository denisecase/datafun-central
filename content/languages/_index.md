This chapter provides an introduction to popular languages for analytics.

## Languages in Analytics

Data analysts often work with a variety of languages, 
which can be broadly categorized into programming languages 
and markup languages. 

Programming languages are further classified into 
compiled and scripting languages. 

Compiled languages, such as Go, Rust, Java, and C# ("C-sharp")
require a separate compilation step to convert source code into 
machine-readable code, 
resulting in faster execution times and better performance optimization. 

Scripting languages, such as Python, R, and JavaScript, 
are interpreted at runtime, 
providing more flexibility and ease of use, 
making them popular choices for data analysis tasks. 

Markup languages, like Markdown, HTML, and CSS, 
are used to structure and present data, 
rather than performing computations. 

Data analysts often use markup languages to store, 
exchange, and visualize data, in conjunction with programming languages 
for data manipulation and analysis. 

Familiarity with various languages across these categories 
enables data analysts to effectively handle diverse data sources, 
perform complex analyses, and communicate results in a clear, accessible manner.

In alphabetical order, 
some of the languages you may encounter include the following.

## [CSS](css)
