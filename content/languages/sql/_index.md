> Structured Query Language

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific programming language 
used to manage and manipulate relational databases. 
SQL is a declarative language, 
meaning that the user specifies what they want to accomplish 
(e.g., "retrieve all records where the age is greater than 18"), 
and the database management system figures out how to execute the request.

## Why SQL?

For data analysts, SQL offers several advantages over other tools:

- SQL is a standardized language used by most 
relational database management systems, including MySQL, 
Oracle, and PostgreSQL.
- It is optimized for working with structured data and is 
well-suited for tasks such as querying and aggregating data, 
joining tables, and filtering data.
- SQL is widely used in industry and is a valuable skill for data analysts 
and data scientists.
- It can be used in conjunction with other programming languages 
like Python and R to perform more complex data analyses.

## SQL Syntax

- SQL syntax is relatively simple and readable, with support for various data types, including integers, floats, strings, and dates.
- SQL uses commands such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, and JOIN to query and manipulate data.
- SQL supports various aggregate functions such as SUM, COUNT, AVG, and MAX, which can be used to summarize data.
- SQL has built-in support for joining tables, filtering data, and creating and modifying database structures.

Here is an example SQL query that retrieves all records where the age is greater than 18 from a table called "users":

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18;
```

## SQL Stored Procedures

SQL stored procedures are a type of SQL code 
stored in a database that can be executed by other programs or scripts. 
Stored procedures are typically used to encapsulate commonly 
used operations or business logic, and can be reused across 
multiple applications.

Here is an example stored procedure that returns the average age 
of all users in a table called "users".

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE get_average_user_age
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT AVG(age) FROM users;
END
```

## Project Management

While SQL itself does not have a formal project management system like 
Julia or Python, it is often used in the context of larger data projects. 
In these cases, SQL queries may be stored in version control systems like Git, 
and may be organized into files or modules based on their functionality.

## Frameworks and Libraries

While SQL itself is not a framework or library, 
there are various tools and libraries that are built on SQL to 
make it easier to work with data. 

Some examples include:

- PostgreSQL: A powerful and flexible relational database management system that supports SQL as well as other programming languages and features.
- MySQL: A popular open-source relational database management system that supports SQL and is commonly used for web applications.
- SQLite: A lightweight, serverless relational database management system that supports SQL and is often used for mobile apps and embedded systems.
- Apache Spark SQL: A Spark module that provides SQL-like syntax for working with large-scale structured data.
- SQLAlchemy: A Python library that provides a SQL toolkit and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system for working with databases in Python.

## File Extensions

Here are some common file extensions used with SQL.

- .sql: The main file extension for SQL scripts, which can contain SQL statements, queries, or commands.
- .sp: The file extension used for stored procedures in Microsoft SQL Server.
- .pks: The file extension used for stored procedure package specifications in Oracle databases.
- .pkb: The file extension used for stored procedure package bodies in Oracle databases.
- .fnc: The file extension used for user-defined function scripts in MySQL and SQL Server.
- .trg: The file extension used for triggers, which are special types of stored procedures that are automatically executed in response to specific events or changes in a database.
- .vw: The file extension used for views, which are virtual tables that provide a customized representation of data from one or more tables in a database.
- .udl: The file extension used for Universal Data Link files, which are Windows-specific files that can be used to store connection strings and other settings for accessing databases.
