JavaScript is a popular programming language used for web development and beyond. 
In this page, we will cover some basics of JavaScript.

## Why JavaScript?

JavaScript is widely used for building web applications, and it's a vital skill for web developers. Some of the reasons to learn JavaScript include:

- Interactivity: JavaScript makes websites more interactive and engaging, allowing for features such as animations, user input validation, and dynamic content updates.

- Front-end web development: JavaScript is used heavily in front-end web development, enabling developers to build user interfaces and dynamic web pages.

- Back-end web development: JavaScript can also be used for back-end web development, allowing developers to build server-side applications and APIs.

- Cross-platform development: With tools like Node.js, JavaScript can be used to build cross-platform applications for desktop and mobile devices.
