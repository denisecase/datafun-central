# Professional Data Analytics

These are set of common pages to help get started with professional 
data analytics, including
 [GitHub](hosting/github.md),
 [Git](tools/git/),
 [Python](languages/python/),
 [Markdown](languages/markdown/),
 [VS Code](tools/vs-code/),
and more.

## Our Goal

Our goal is to help you get productive quickly and effectively.
We introduce the general landscape and terms, and provide a bit of 
what they do and why we think these tools are worth learning. 
Details are left to outside resources. 

## Requirements

Recommended choices are nearly always free and open-source. 
You will need a relatively modern machine and electricity to keep it running.
Your curiousity, resourcefulness, and tenacity will be quite valuable.
