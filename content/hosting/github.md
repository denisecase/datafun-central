GitHub is a web-based **platform** that allows developers to store and manage 
their code and collaborate with others. It is built on top of Git, 
which is a distributed version control system that allows developers 
to track changes to their code over time and collaborate with others 
on the same codebase.

With GitHub, developers can create their own repositories, 
which are essentially folders that contain their code, documentation, 
and other files related to a specific project. 
They can also fork other people's repositories to create their own copies, 
which they can then modify and contribute back to the original repository. 
This allows for easy collaboration and code sharing among developers.

GitHub also provides a range of tools for developers to manage their code, 
such as the ability to track and resolve issues, review and 
merge pull requests, and create and manage branches. 
It also provides a 
web-based interface for viewing and editing code, as well as a built-in 
code editor. 
Additionally, it has a wide range of integrations and 
APIs that allow developers to automate various development tasks and 
integrate with other tools and services.

## Integrated Editing - New!

You can use the github.dev web-based editor to edit files and 
commit your changes from your browser. 

To try it, when viewing a repository in your browser:

1. Change the URL from "github.com" to "github.dev".
2. When viewing a file, use the dropdown menu next to  and select github.dev.

## GitHub Renders Executed Jupyter Notebooks 

GitHub has the ability to render Jupyter notebooks directly within its platform, 
allowing users to view and interact with notebooks without having to 
download or install any software. 
However, this feature only works if 
the Jupyter notebook **has been executed first** and saved as an `.ipynb` file.

When a Jupyter notebook is executed, 
the output cells are stored within the .ipynb file along with the code cells. 
This means that when the notebook is opened on GitHub, 
the output cells can be rendered and displayed alongside the code.

If a Jupyter notebook has not been executed before being uploaded to GitHub, 
then the output cells will not be present in the file, 
and therefore will not be displayed when the notebook is opened on GitHub. 
In this case, users will need to download the notebook 
and execute it locally in order to view the output cells.
