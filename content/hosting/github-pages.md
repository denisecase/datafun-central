GitHub Pages is a free and easy way to host static websites directly 
from your GitHub repositories. 
It is ideal for hosting personal blogs, project documentation, 
or simple websites. 
With GitHub Pages, you can quickly create a site using Markdown, 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have it automatically generated and 
hosted by GitHub.

Some key features of GitHub Pages include:

## Easy setup

Setting up a GitHub Pages site is simple and requires only a few steps. You can create a new repository or use an existing one, add your content, and enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.

## Custom domains

By default, GitHub Pages sites are hosted under a github.io subdomain, but you can also configure a custom domain for your site.

## Jekyll integration

GitHub Pages integrates seamlessly with Jekyll, a popular static site generator. 
This allows you to write your content in Markdown, use templates and themes, 
and have Jekyll automatically generate your site's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Hugo support

GitHub Pages also supports hosting websites generated with Hugo. 
Hugo is an open-source static site generator written in Go, 
known for its speed and flexibility. 
It enables you to create websites using Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
and comes with a rich set of features, including templates, themes, shortcodes, 
and built-in support for taxonomies such as categories and tags. 
Hugo is designed to handle large sites efficiently, making it a 
popular choice for blogs, portfolios, and documentation sites.

## Version control

Since GitHub Pages sites are hosted directly from your GitHub repositories, 
you get all the benefits of version control. This makes it easy to track 
changes, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions of your site if needed.

## SSL support

GitHub Pages provides free SSL support for both github.io subdomains and 
custom domains, ensuring secure connections for your site visitors.
