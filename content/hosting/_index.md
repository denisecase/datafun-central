## [BitBucket](bitbucket)

## [DockerHub](dockerhub)

## [GitHub](github)

GitHub is a widely used platform for hosting Git repositories, 
collaborating on code, and managing projects.

## [GitHub Pages](github-pages)

directly from a GitHub repository.

## [JupyterHub](jupyterhub)

JupyterHub is a multi-user server for Jupyter Notebooks that allows multiple users to access and use the same Jupyter Notebook environment simultaneously.

## BinderHub vs JupyterHub

JupyterHub and BinderHub are both tools for providing multi-user environments for Jupyter Notebooks, but differ in their use cases and functionality.

JupyterHub is for multi-user environments within an organization, such as a research lab or classroom. It allows users to access a shared Jupyter Notebook server and provides tools for managing user access and permissions.

BinderHub is for sharing Jupyter Notebooks and interactive computing environments with others over the web. It allows you to turn a GitHub repository into a shareable, interactive computing environment with a single click. BinderHub uses JupyterHub behind the scenes to provision and manage the computing environment, but it also provides additional functionality for managing and sharing Binder deployments.

Both tools use JupyterHub, but serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.
