## Advanced Python Skills

These skills are considered advanced and will be useful for more advanced data analysis tasks.

### Object-Oriented Programming

- Understand the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP) and how to apply it in Python.
- Create and use classes to encapsulate related data and functionality.
- Use inheritance and polymorphism to extend existing classes and create new ones.

### Functional Programming

- Understand the principles of functional programming and how to use functional programming concepts in Python.
- Use lambda functions and higher-order functions to create more expressive and powerful code.
- Apply functional programming techniques to data processing and analysis tasks.

### Decorators

- Understand what decorators are and how to use them to modify the behavior of functions and methods.
- Use built-in Python decorators like `@property`, `@staticmethod`, and `@classmethod`.
- Create custom decorators to add functionality to your code.

### Generators and Iterators

- Understand the difference between generators and iterators and how to use them in Python.
- Use generators to lazily generate and process data without creating large in-memory data structures.
- Implement custom iterators to provide custom ways of iterating over data.

### Concurrency and Parallelism

- Understand the difference between concurrency and parallelism and how to achieve both in Python.
- Use threads and processes to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
- Use asynchronous programming techniques to handle I/O-bound tasks efficiently.

### Performance Optimization

- Understand how to optimize Python code for performance.
- Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in your code.
- Apply performance optimization techniques like caching, memoization, and vectorization to speed up your code.
