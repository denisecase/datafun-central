## Advanced Python Skills

These skills are considered advanced and will be useful for more advanced data analysis tasks.

### Object-Oriented Programming

- Understand the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP) and how to apply it in Python.
- Create and use classes to encapsulate related data and functionality.
- Use inheritance and polymorphism to extend existing classes and create new ones.

### Functional Programming

- Understand the principles of functional programming and how to use functional programming concepts in Python.
- Use lambda functions and higher-order functions to create more expressive and powerful code.
- Apply functional programming techniques to data processing and analysis tasks.

### Decorators

- Understand what decorators are and how to use them to modify the behavior of functions and methods.
- Use built-in Python decorators like `@property`, `@staticmethod`, and `@classmethod`.
- Create custom decorators to add functionality to your code.

### Generators and Iterators

- Understand the difference between generators and iterators and how to use them in Python.
- Use generators to lazily generate and process data without creating large in-memory data structures.
- Implement custom iterators to provide custom ways of iterating over data.

### Concurrency and Parallelism

- Understand the difference between concurrency and parallelism and how to achieve both in Python.
- Use threads and processes to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
- Use asynchronous programming techniques to handle I/O-bound tasks efficiently.

### Performance Optimization

- Understand how to optimize Python code for performance.
- Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in your code.
- Apply performance optimization techniques like 
[caching](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-speed-up-your-python-code-with-caching-c1ea979d0276), 
[memoization](https://python.plainenglish.io/boosting-python-code-performance-with-memoization-d98efd735902), and 
[vectorization](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/vectorization-python/) to speed up your code.

### Independent Study

Books remain a surprisingly cost-effective investment. 

When you're ready to truly master this powersful language, 
consider investing in a top-rated book like "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho. 
The second edition is current, 
published in March 2022 covering up to Python 3.10 for the newest features.
