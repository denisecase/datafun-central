The following Python skills and techniques
may be considered **basic** level in the context of data analysis. 

## Data Structures

- **Lists**: Know how to create and manipulate lists, and use them to store and organize data.

- **Dictionaries**: Know how to create and manipulate dictionaries, and use them to store and organize data in key-value pairs.

## Control Structures

- **Conditional Statements**: Know how to use if-else statements to conditionally execute code.

- **Loops**: Know how to use for and while loops to iterate over data.

## Functions

- **Defining Functions**: Know how to define functions to organize and reuse code.

- **Lambda Functions**: Know how to define and use lambda functions for short and simple functions.

## File I/O

- **Reading and Writing Files**: Know how to read and write data from files using Python.

## External Libraries

- **NumPy**: Know how to use NumPy to perform numerical operations and calculations.

- **pandas**: Know how to use pandas to work with structured data and perform data analysis tasks.

- **Matplotlib**: Know how to use Matplotlib to create basic plots and visualizations.

These skills and the associated techniques provide a strong foundation for data analysis in Python, 
and can be built upon with more advanced topics and libraries as needed.
