This page provides an overview of different techniques for cleaning data, 
a key step in the data analysis process. 
Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting errors, 
inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in data to ensure that it is 
accurate, complete, and usable for analysis.

## Why Data Cleaning is Important

Data cleaning is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability 
of data analysis results. Dirty data, or data that has not been 
properly cleaned, can lead to inaccurate conclusions, 
wasted time and resources, and missed opportunities for 
insights and discoveries. By cleaning data before analysis, 
data analysts can ensure that their findings are based on 
accurate and high-quality data.

## Techniques for Data Cleaning

There are many different techniques for data cleaning, 
depending on the type and quality of the data. 

Some common techniques include:

- Handling missing or incomplete data
- Removing duplicate or irrelevant data
- Correcting data errors and inconsistencies
- Handling outliers and anomalies
- Standardizing data formats and units
- Validating and verifying data quality

Data analysts may use a combination of these techniques 
to clean data and prepare it for analysis.
