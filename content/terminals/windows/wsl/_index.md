Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature of Windows 10 
that allows users to run a Linux environment directly on Windows, 
without the need for a virtual machine or container. 
WSL provides access to a full-fledged Linux system, 
including a terminal emulator and support for running 
Linux applications and scripts.

WSL supports two different versions:

- WSL 1: Uses a translation layer to provide compatibility between Linux system calls and Windows kernel system calls. WSL 1 provides access to a full Linux environment, but can be slower than running Linux natively.

- WSL 2: Uses a lightweight virtual machine to provide a complete Linux kernel running directly on Windows. WSL 2 provides improved performance and compatibility with Linux applications, but requires more system resources.

WSL includes a range of Linux commands and utilities, 
allowing users to perform tasks like navigating the file system, 
managing packages, and running scripts. 
Users can also install and use Linux applications and development tools directly within WSL, including:

- Python, Ruby, and other programming languages.
- Git, Subversion, and other version control systems.
- Apache, NGINX, and other web servers.
- Docker, Kubernetes, and other containerization tools.
