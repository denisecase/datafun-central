Windows offers multiple terminal options for developers and users,
and many are widely used. Skills in any or all of these can be very valuable. 


## [Command Prompt](command-prompt)

The Command Prompt is a basic terminal emulator that has been 
included in Windows since the early days. It supports running basic commands, 
navigating the file system, and running batch scripts. 
However, it lacks some of the advanced features found in modern terminal emulators.

## [Git Bash](git-bash)

Git Bash is a terminal emulator that is bundled with Git for Windows. 
It provides a Unix-like command-line environment for Windows, including 
support for common Unix utilities and shell scripting. 
It also includes Git-specific features, such as auto-completion for Git 
commands and syntax highlighting for diffs.

## [PowerShell](powershell)

PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language designed for 
system administration and automation. 
It provides a more powerful and flexible command-line environment 
than the Command Prompt, with support for features like 
object-oriented pipelines, remote management, and scripting with .NET objects.

PowerShell includes Intellisense to help complete commands. 
To accept a suggestion, use the **right arrow key** (instead of tab).

## [Windows Subsystem for Linux](wsl)

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature of Windows 10 that allows 
users to run a Linux environment directly on Windows, without the need 
for a virtual machine or container. It provides access to a full-fledged 
Linux system, including a terminal emulator and support for running 
Linux applications and scripts. WSL can be used for development, 
testing, and running Linux-based tools and utilities on Windows.

Knowledge of Linux commands can be especially helpful in 
security and digital forensic investigations.
