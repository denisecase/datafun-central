PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language 
designed for system administration and automation in Windows. 
PowerShell provides a more powerful and flexible command-line environment 
than the Command Prompt, with support for features like 
object-oriented pipelines, remote management, and scripting with .NET objects.

PowerShell includes a wide range of built-in commands, called cmdlets, 
that provide access to various Windows management features, such as:

- Get-Process: Display information about running processes, including process ID (PID), CPU and memory usage, and parent process ID.
- Get-Service: Display information about system services, including status, startup type, and dependencies.
- Get-ChildItem: List the contents of a directory and display file information, including timestamps and permissions.
- Set-Content: Write text to a file.
- Invoke-WebRequest: Retrieve content from a web page or API.

In addition to these built-in cmdlets, 
PowerShell supports a range of scripting and automation features, including:

- Variables and data types: PowerShell supports a range of data types, including strings, numbers, and arrays, as well as variables for storing and manipulating data.
- Control flow statements: PowerShell supports a range of control flow statements, including loops, conditionals, and switch statements.
- Functions: PowerShell supports the creation of reusable functions, allowing for modular and organized scripts.
- Remote management: PowerShell can be used to manage remote Windows machines, allowing for automation and management of distributed systems.

PowerShell is a powerful and flexible tool for 
system administration and automation in Windows, providing access to a 
wide range of management features and automation capabilities.
