On Mac and Linux machines, the **Terminal** app is widely used.

Terminal is a **command-line interface** 
that allows users to interact with their computer using text commands. 
It provides a way to execute commands, manage files, and run scripts 
without the need for a graphical user interface. 

The Terminal can be accessed by opening the Terminal application on a 
Mac or by opening a terminal emulator on a Linux distribution. 

Once in the Terminal, users can navigate the file system, run commands, 
and install and manage software packages. The Terminal is a powerful tool 
for advanced users and developers, allowing for efficient and precise 
control over the computer. However, it does require some knowledge of 
command-line interfaces and syntax, which can be intimidating when getting started.

**Homebrew** is useful commnad line tool for managing software packages 
in Terminal.
