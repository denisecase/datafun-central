A terminal, or command line interface, is a text-based way to interact with your computer. Terminals can be faster and more powerful than graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for many tasks, especially tasks that involve file management, development, or automation.

This page provides an introduction to some widely-used terminals.

## [Mac and Linux](mac-linux)

Mac and Linux systems offer the Terminal app, which provides a command-line interface for navigating the file system, running commands, and executing scripts. The Terminal supports a wide range of commands and utilities, and can be customized with various themes and configurations to suit individual preferences.

## [PowerShell](powershell)

PowerShell is a powerful terminal and scripting language offered by Microsoft for all platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. PowerShell provides a more powerful and flexible command-line environment than the Command Prompt, with support for features like object-oriented pipelines, remote management, and scripting with .NET objects.

## [VS Code Terminal](vs-code-terminal)

The terminal in Visual Studio Code offers a built-in command-line interface for developers. It provides access to a range of commands and utilities, including those specific to development tasks like running build scripts, testing code, and debugging applications.

## [Windows Terminals](windows)

Windows offers a variety of terminals depending on the user's needs and preferences. These terminals include:

- Command Prompt: A basic terminal emulator that has been included in Windows since the early days.
- Git Bash: A terminal emulator that is bundled with Git for Windows. It provides a Unix-like command-line environment for Windows, including support for common Unix utilities and shell scripting.
- PowerShell: A command-line shell and scripting language that is designed for system administration and automation in Windows.
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL): A feature of Windows 10 that allows users to run a Linux environment directly on Windows, without the need for a virtual machine or container.

Each of these terminals provides a unique set of features and capabilities, allowing users to choose the terminal that best fits their needs and workflow.
