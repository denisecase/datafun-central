PowerShell Core is the cross-platform version of PowerShell. 
It was developed by Microsoft as an open-source project and 
is designed to run on Windows, Linux, and macOS, making it a truly cross-platform tool. 
PowerShell Core has a similar syntax and features to the traditional Windows PowerShell, 
but with additional cross-platform capabilities and support for running on a variety of operating systems.

PowerShell Core also includes many improvements and new features compared to the older Windows PowerShell, including improved performance, support for Docker containers, 
and enhanced security features. PowerShell Core also has its own module repository, 
called the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/), where users can download and install community-built PowerShell modules.

Here are some common use cases:

## Analytics

- Data collection and analysis: PowerShell can be used to collect and process data from various sources, including databases, logs, and web services. It can also be used to perform data analysis tasks such as data cleansing, transformation, and aggregation.

- Reporting: PowerShell can be used to generate reports and visualizations based on data collected and analyzed from various sources. This can include dashboards, charts, and other types of visualizations.

- Machine learning: PowerShell can be used to develop and train machine learning models using libraries such as Microsoft's Cognitive Services and TensorFlow.

## Digital forensics

- Data acquisition: PowerShell can be used to acquire data from disk images, memory dumps, and other sources for forensic analysis.

- Evidence examination: PowerShell can be used to search for specific file types, keywords, and other indicators of compromise within acquired data.

- Data recovery: PowerShell can be used to recover data from damaged or corrupted drives, and to reconstruct deleted or lost files.

- Network analysis: PowerShell can be used to analyze network traffic and investigate potential security incidents or threats.

## System administration

PowerShell provides a powerful command-line interface for managing Windows operating systems, including managing users and groups, configuring network settings, installing software, and performing other administrative tasks.

## Automation

PowerShell can be used to automate repetitive tasks, such as backups, file transfers, and system maintenance tasks. PowerShell scripts can be scheduled to run automatically or triggered by events such as system startup or user logon.

## Development

PowerShell includes a full-featured scripting language with access to the .NET Framework and other APIs, making it a powerful tool for developing and testing applications and scripts.

## Cloud computing

PowerShell can be used to manage cloud services and resources on platforms such as Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). PowerShell modules and cmdlets are available for managing virtual machines, storage, networking, and other cloud services.

## Security

PowerShell includes a range of security features, including execution policies, code signing, and encryption, making it a valuable tool for securing systems and managing user access to resources.
