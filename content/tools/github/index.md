GitHub is a popular, web-based platform that allows data analysts and developers 
to store and manage their code and collaborate with others.

GitHub is built on [Git](https://nwmissouri.instructure.com/courses/50814/pages/git "Git"), 
which is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes 
to their code over time and collaborate with others on the same codebase.

With GitHub, developers can create their own **repositories**, 
which are essentially **folders** that contain their code, documentation, 
and other files related to a specific project. They can also **fork** other people's 
repositories to create their own copies, which they can then modify and 
contribute back to the original repository. 
This allows for easy collaboration and code sharing among developers.

GitHub provides tools for developers to manage their code, 
such as the ability to track and resolve issues, 
review and merge pull requests, and create and manage branches. 
It also provides a web-based interface for viewing and editing code, 
as well as a built-in code editor. 
Additionally, it has a wide range of integrations and APIs that allow developers 
to automate various development tasks and integrate with other tools and services.

## Sign Up For A Free Account

Sign up for a free account with [GitHub.com](https://github.com/), 
a code hosting platform that manages a vast number of programming projects. 
Follow their website instructions to get started. 
See the recommendations on GitHub **email** and **username** below.

### GitHub Email

You'll need an email. 
I use a permanent personal email for most GitHub work, 
rather than a work or school account (which may be temporary). 
Your email will not be made public.

### GitHub Username

You'll create a GitHub username. 
Your username will be public. 
Your username can be anonymous (e.g., 'analystextraordinaire') 
or publicly associated with you. 
For example, I use 'denisecase'. 
Your username will be a part of the URL to all of your projects.

## GitHub Repositories

Each coding project lives in a GitHub repository (called 'repo' for short) in the 'cloud' (a distributed group of machines).

Git (the system) keeps track of committed changes to an evolving project.   
    - The GitHub repo can be kept in sync with a git repo on your local machine.   
    - For example:  
        - If a GitHub repo is named **datafun-01-getting-started**.   
        - On my machine, it's in my **Documents/datafun-01-getting-started** directory.

## More About GitHub

The following definition of GitHub comes from<span> </span>[Kinsta.com](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-github/)

_At a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. To understand exactly what GitHub is, you need to know two connected principles: Version control, which helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code, and Git, which is a specific open-source version control system._
