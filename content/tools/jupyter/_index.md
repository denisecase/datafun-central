Jupyter is an open-source web application that allows users to 
create and share documents that contain live code, equations, 
visualizations, and narrative text. 
It is a popular tool for data analysis, scientific computing, 
and machine learning, and is widely used in academic research, 
industry, and data science education.

Jupyter provides the following features.

## Interactive Computing

Jupyter notebooks allow users to write and execute code interactively, providing
an interactive computing environment. This allows users to explore data, prototype
algorithms, and create visualizations in a single, cohesive environment.

## Multiple Language Support

Jupyter supports multiple programming languages, including Python, R, and Julia.
This makes it easy to integrate different tools and frameworks and collaborate
with colleagues who use different programming languages.

## Collaboration

Jupyter notebooks can be shared with others, allowing for easy collaboration and
reproducibility of analyses. This also facilitates communication and knowledge sharing
among team members and stakeholders.

## Visualization

Jupyter notebooks support interactive visualization libraries such as Matplotlib,
Bokeh, and Plotly, making it easy to create and share data visualizations.

## Integration

Jupyter notebooks can be integrated with other tools and frameworks such as
Git, GitHub, and Docker. This makes it easy to manage version control, share
code and data, and deploy projects.

## Ecosystem

Jupyter has a rich ecosystem of tools and services, such as 
JupyterLab, JupyterHub, and Binder, 
that can help streamline the development and deployment process. 
Many third-party tools and plugins also integrate with Jupyter to 
extend its functionality.
