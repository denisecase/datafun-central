**Conda** is a cross-platform **package manager** primarily focused on 
**Python** and **R** programming languages. 
It is designed to manage packages and dependencies for data science and 
machine learning projects. conda can create and manage environments, 
allowing you to maintain multiple versions of Python and installed packages. 

It is often used in conjunction with the Anaconda distribution, 
which provides a comprehensive suite of data science tools and libraries, or 
its smaller version, Miniconda.
