**Docker** is an open-source **platform** that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications by using containerization technology. It allows developers to package an application and its dependencies (libraries, configuration files, etc.) into a single, lightweight, and portable container. These containers can run consistently across different environments, simplifying application development, testing, and deployment.

Docker provides the following features.

## Containerization

Docker uses containerization to isolate applications and their dependencies 
into separate, self-contained units. This approach ensures that each application 
runs in a consistent environment, reducing conflicts and improving security.

## Image Management

Docker images are templates used to create containers. They are lightweight and 
can be easily shared, stored, and versioned. Docker Hub, the official public 
registry, hosts thousands of pre-built images for various programming languages, frameworks, and tools.

## Portability

Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker, regardless of the 
underlying infrastructure or platform. This makes it easy to deploy and migrate 
applications across different environments, such as development, testing, and 
production.

## Scalability

Docker enables horizontal scaling of applications by allowing you to deploy 
multiple instances of the same container. This approach can help distribute the 
load across multiple resources and improve application performance.

## Version Control

Docker images can be versioned and stored in registries, making it easy to 
rollback, upgrade, or downgrade applications as needed. This also facilitates 
collaboration among team members, as they can share and use the same 
image versions.

## Ecosystem

Docker has a rich ecosystem of tools and services and many
third-party tools and plugins integrate with 
Docker to extend its functionality.

## Managing Containers

Docker containers can be managed with **Kubernetes**, 
a popular open-source container orchestration platform. Kubernetes is designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, including Docker containers.

Kubernetes provides features such as automatic scaling, self-healing, and load balancing. 
Kubernetes can manage Docker containers running on a single host or across a cluster of hosts, abstracting away the underlying infrastructure and providing a consistent and scalable platform for running containerized workloads.

Technologies such as Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Nomad, and OpenShift perform similar functions to Kubernetes.

## Installation

The installation process for Docker depends on your operating system. Follow the instructions below based on your platform.

## Common Files

When working with Docker, you'll encounter several common files. 

### Dockerfile

File used to define the steps required to build a Docker image. 

Dockerfile contains instructions such as

- FROM - specifies the base image to use
- RUN - runs commands to install dependencies and set up the environment
- COPY - copies files from the host machine into the image
- CMD - specifies the command to run when the container is started

### docker-compose.yml

Defines and runs multi-container Docker applications. 

docker-compose.yml allows developers to define the services that make up 
the application, their dependencies, and how they are connected. 
This file can be used to start, stop, and manage 
containers in a multi-container application.

### .dockerignore

Like .gitignore in Git repositories, 
.dockerignore is used to specify files and directories 
that should be excluded from the Docker build context. 

By excluding unnecessary files and directories, 
the Docker build process is faster and more efficient.

### Dockerfile.dev

Dockerfile.dev is a Dockerfile variant for development environments. 

It contains additional instructions for setting up a development environment, 
such as installing development tools and enabling debugging.
