Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free and open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. 
It is available on Windows, Linux, and macOS and offers features such as debugging, syntax highlighting, and intelligent code completion.

Some of the key features of VS Code include:

- Built-in Git integration
- Support for multiple languages and frameworks
- Extensions for customizing the editor and adding new functionality
- Debugging capabilities for Node.js, Python, and other languages
- Integrated terminal for running commands and scripts

Using a modern editor or IDE can make your coding experience more efficient and productive.


## Why VS Code

One reason we teach VS Code over Python-specific IDEs like Spyder and PyCharm is that VS Code is a more general-purpose code editor that supports multiple languages and workflows. 
While Spyder and PyCharm are great for working with Python specifically, 
VS Code is capable of handling a wider range of tasks and can be used for web development, data analysis, and more.

VS Code has a lot of built-in functionality for working with other languages commonly used in data analysis, including Markdown and SQL. 
This makes it a great choice for someone who is just getting started with programming and data analysis and wants to learn a more versatile environment.

VS Code is widely used and well-supported, with many resources for learning how to use it effectively. In addition to the comprehensive official documenttaion, there are articles and videos available for begineers through experts.
