Git is a popular tool used to help collaborate with others and keep track of code changes over time.

At a high level, Git is a **version control system** for tracking changes in evolving code projects. 
Using Git allows you to easily revert to an earlier version of code if you make a mistake or if a change causes unexpected problems.

Git makes it easy to collaborate with others on code. 
You can use Git to share your code with others, 
track changes that they make, and 
merge their changes back into your codebase. 
This makes it a great tool for open source development, 
where many people may be working on the same codebase at the same time.

In this Git introduction, we'll start with the basics of using Git, including setting up your Git environment, creating a repository, and making commits. We'll also cover more advanced topics like branching, merging, and collaborating with others. 

## Installation

The installation process for Git depends on your operating system. Follow the instructions below based on your platform:

- [Git Installation](installation/)

## Configuration

After installing, configure Git with your name and email address.

- [Git Configuration](configuration/)

## Using Git

When it comes to using Git, you have a few options for how to interact with it. 
One option is to use Git in the terminal, 
which involves typing out commands and working with the Git 
command line interface. 
Another option is to use a Git integration in your Integrated Development 
Environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

Using Git in the terminal can be a bit intimidating, 
as it requires memorizing and typing out specific commands. 
However, it can be a useful skill to have, 
especially if you work on projects that require using Git outside of an IDE.

On the other hand, 
using a Git integration in your IDE can make the process of working 
with Git more user-friendly and intuitive, 
as you can often perform Git actions with a few clicks or keystrokes. 
For example, VS Code has built-in Git support and provides a 
visual interface for common Git actions such as committing changes, 
creating branches, and merging changes.
