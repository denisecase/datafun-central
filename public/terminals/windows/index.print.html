<h1 id="windows">Windows</h1>

<p>Windows offers multiple terminal options for developers and users,
and many are widely used. Skills in any or all of these can be very valuable.</p>
<h2 id="command-promptcommand-prompt"><a href="../../terminals/windows/command-prompt">Command Prompt</a></h2>
<p>The Command Prompt is a basic terminal emulator that has been
included in Windows since the early days. It supports running basic commands,
navigating the file system, and running batch scripts.
However, it lacks some of the advanced features found in modern terminal emulators.</p>
<h2 id="git-bashgit-bash"><a href="../../terminals/windows/git-bash">Git Bash</a></h2>
<p>Git Bash is a terminal emulator that is bundled with Git for Windows.
It provides a Unix-like command-line environment for Windows, including
support for common Unix utilities and shell scripting.
It also includes Git-specific features, such as auto-completion for Git
commands and syntax highlighting for diffs.</p>
<h2 id="powershellpowershell"><a href="../../terminals/windows/powershell">PowerShell</a></h2>
<p>PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language designed for
system administration and automation.
It provides a more powerful and flexible command-line environment
than the Command Prompt, with support for features like
object-oriented pipelines, remote management, and scripting with .NET objects.</p>
<p>PowerShell includes Intellisense to help complete commands.
To accept a suggestion, use the <strong>right arrow key</strong> (instead of tab).</p>
<h2 id="windows-subsystem-for-linuxwsl"><a href="../../terminals/windows/wsl">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a></h2>
<p>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature of Windows 10 that allows
users to run a Linux environment directly on Windows, without the need
for a virtual machine or container. It provides access to a full-fledged
Linux system, including a terminal emulator and support for running
Linux applications and scripts. WSL can be used for development,
testing, and running Linux-based tools and utilities on Windows.</p>
<p>Knowledge of Linux commands can be especially helpful in
security and digital forensic investigations.</p>

<p>The Command Prompt is a basic terminal emulator that has been included in Windows since the early days.
It provides a command-line interface for interacting with the file system,
running basic commands, and executing batch scripts.</p>
<p>The Command Prompt supports a range of commands, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>dir: List the contents of a directory.</li>
<li>cd: Change the current directory.</li>
<li>md: Create a new directory.</li>
<li>del: Delete files.</li>
<li>copy: Copy files.</li>
<li>move: Move files.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these basic commands, the Command Prompt supports a range of advanced features, such as redirection of input and output, piping of commands, and batch scripting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple and lightweight tool well-suited for basic tasks
and for users who prefer a minimalist interface.</p>
<p>However, it lacks some of the advanced features and flexibility
found in more modern terminal emulators like
PowerShell and GitBash.</p>

<p>Git Bash is a terminal emulator that is bundled with Git for Windows.
It provides a Unix-like command-line environment for Windows,
including support for common Unix utilities and shell scripting.
Git Bash includes a range of features and commands that are useful for
developers working with Git repositories, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>git: A command-line interface for interacting with Git repositories, including tasks like cloning, committing, pushing, and merging changes.</li>
<li>ssh: A command-line interface for managing secure shell connections to remote servers and devices.</li>
<li>curl: A command-line tool for transferring data over various protocols, including HTTP and FTP.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these Git-specific features, Git Bash supports a
range of general-purpose commands and utilities, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>ls: List the contents of a directory.</li>
<li>cd: Change the current directory.</li>
<li>mkdir: Create a new directory.</li>

<h1 id="powershell">PowerShell</h1>

<p>PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language
designed for system administration and automation in Windows.
PowerShell provides a more powerful and flexible command-line environment
than the Command Prompt, with support for features like
object-oriented pipelines, remote management, and scripting with .NET objects.</p>
<p>PowerShell includes a wide range of built-in commands, called cmdlets,
that provide access to various Windows management features, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get-Process: Display information about running processes, including process ID (PID), CPU and memory usage, and parent process ID.</li>
<li>Get-Service: Display information about system services, including status, startup type, and dependencies.</li>
<li>Get-ChildItem: List the contents of a directory and display file information, including timestamps and permissions.</li>
<li>Set-Content: Write text to a file.</li>
<li>Invoke-WebRequest: Retrieve content from a web page or API.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these built-in cmdlets,
PowerShell supports a range of scripting and automation features, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variables and data types: PowerShell supports a range of data types, including strings, numbers, and arrays, as well as variables for storing and manipulating data.</li>
<li>Control flow statements: PowerShell supports a range of control flow statements, including loops, conditionals, and switch statements.</li>
<li>Functions: PowerShell supports the creation of reusable functions, allowing for modular and organized scripts.</li>
<li>Remote management: PowerShell can be used to manage remote Windows machines, allowing for automation and management of distributed systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>PowerShell is a powerful and flexible tool for
system administration and automation in Windows, providing access to a
wide range of management features and automation capabilities.</p>

<h1 id="windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl">Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</h1>

<p>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature of Windows 10
that allows users to run a Linux environment directly on Windows,
without the need for a virtual machine or container.
WSL provides access to a full-fledged Linux system,
including a terminal emulator and support for running
Linux applications and scripts.</p>
<p>WSL supports two different versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>WSL 1: Uses a translation layer to provide compatibility between Linux system calls and Windows kernel system calls. WSL 1 provides access to a full Linux environment, but can be slower than running Linux natively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WSL 2: Uses a lightweight virtual machine to provide a complete Linux kernel running directly on Windows. WSL 2 provides improved performance and compatibility with Linux applications, but requires more system resources.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>WSL includes a range of Linux commands and utilities,
allowing users to perform tasks like navigating the file system,
managing packages, and running scripts.
Users can also install and use Linux applications and development tools directly within WSL, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python, Ruby, and other programming languages.</li>
<li>Git, Subversion, and other version control systems.</li>
<li>Apache, NGINX, and other web servers.</li>
<li>Docker, Kubernetes, and other containerization tools.</li>
</ul>
