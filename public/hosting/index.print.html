<h1 id="dockerhub">Dockerhub</h1>

<p>Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository service provided by Docker,
similar to GitHub, but specifically designed for sharing and managing
Docker images. Just as GitHub is a platform for storing and collaborating
on code repositories, Docker Hub allows you to store, share, and
collaborate on Docker images. Docker Hub simplifies the process of
distributing and deploying containerized applications and streamlines
collaboration with other developers.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a brief introduction to some key features.</p>
<h2 id="public-and-private-repositories">Public and private repositories</h2>
<p>Docker Hub allows you to create both public and private repositories for your Docker images. Public repositories are accessible to everyone, while private repositories can only be accessed by authorized users.</p>
<h2 id="image-versioning">Image versioning</h2>
<p>Docker Hub supports versioning of Docker images using tags, which allows you to maintain multiple versions of an image in the same repository. This is similar to using branches in a Git repository to manage different versions of your code.</p>
<h2 id="automated-builds">Automated builds</h2>
<p>You can link your Docker Hub repository to a GitHub or Bitbucket repository, enabling automated builds of Docker images whenever code is pushed to the linked repository. This feature ensures that your Docker images are always up-to-date with your source code.</p>
<h2 id="webhooks">Webhooks</h2>
<p>Docker Hub supports webhooks, which can be used to trigger events or notifications when a new image is pushed to a repository. This can help automate deployment workflows and keep your applications up-to-date.</p>
<h2 id="official-images">Official images</h2>
<p>Docker Hub hosts a wide range of official images for popular programming languages, frameworks, and tools. These images are maintained by their respective organizations or developers and can be used as a base for building your own custom images.</p>
<h2 id="community-contributed-images">Community-contributed images</h2>
<p>In addition to official images, Docker Hub also hosts thousands of community-contributed images. These images are created and maintained by Docker users and can be a valuable resource when you&rsquo;re looking for a pre-built solution or starting point for your own images.</p>
<h2 id="get-started">Get Started</h2>
<p>To get started with Docker Hub, sign up for a free account.
Once you have an account, you can create your own repositories,
browse and search for images, and collaborate with other users.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with GitHub, you&rsquo;ll find many similarities in the way
Docker Hub organizes and manages repositories, making it easy to transition
between the two platforms.</p>

<h1 id="github">Github</h1>

<p>GitHub is a web-based <strong>platform</strong> that allows developers to store and manage
their code and collaborate with others. It is built on top of Git,
which is a distributed version control system that allows developers
to track changes to their code over time and collaborate with others
on the same codebase.</p>
<p>With GitHub, developers can create their own repositories,
which are essentially folders that contain their code, documentation,
and other files related to a specific project.
They can also fork other people&rsquo;s repositories to create their own copies,
which they can then modify and contribute back to the original repository.
This allows for easy collaboration and code sharing among developers.</p>
<p>GitHub also provides a range of tools for developers to manage their code,
such as the ability to track and resolve issues, review and
merge pull requests, and create and manage branches. It also provides a
web-based interface for viewing and editing code, as well as a built-in
code editor. Additionally, it has a wide range of integrations and
APIs that allow developers to automate various development tasks and
integrate with other tools and services.</p>
<h2 id="integrated-editing---new">Integrated Editing - New!</h2>
<p>You can use the github.dev web-based editor to edit files and
commit your changes from your browser.</p>
<p>To try it, when viewing a repository in your browser:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change the URL from &ldquo;github.com&rdquo; to &ldquo;github.dev&rdquo;.</li>
<li>When viewing a file, use the dropdown menu next to  and select github.dev.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="github-pages">Github Pages</h1>

<p>GitHub Pages is a free and easy way to host static websites directly
from your GitHub repositories.
It is ideal for hosting personal blogs, project documentation,
or simple websites.
With GitHub Pages, you can quickly create a site using Markdown,
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have it automatically generated and
hosted by GitHub.</p>
<p>Some key features of GitHub Pages include:</p>
<h2 id="easy-setup">Easy setup</h2>
<p>Setting up a GitHub Pages site is simple and requires only a few steps. You can create a new repository or use an existing one, add your content, and enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.</p>
<h2 id="custom-domains">Custom domains</h2>
<p>By default, GitHub Pages sites are hosted under a github.io subdomain, but you can also configure a custom domain for your site.</p>
<h2 id="jekyll-integration">Jekyll integration</h2>
<p>GitHub Pages integrates seamlessly with Jekyll, a popular static site generator.
This allows you to write your content in Markdown, use templates and themes,
and have Jekyll automatically generate your site&rsquo;s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="hugo-support">Hugo support</h2>
<p>GitHub Pages also supports hosting websites generated with Hugo.
Hugo is an open-source static site generator written in Go,
known for its speed and flexibility.
It enables you to create websites using Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
and comes with a rich set of features, including templates, themes, shortcodes,
and built-in support for taxonomies such as categories and tags.
Hugo is designed to handle large sites efficiently, making it a
popular choice for blogs, portfolios, and documentation sites.</p>
<h2 id="version-control">Version control</h2>
<p>Since GitHub Pages sites are hosted directly from your GitHub repositories,
you get all the benefits of version control. This makes it easy to track
changes, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions of your site if needed.</p>
<h2 id="ssl-support">SSL support</h2>
<p>GitHub Pages provides free SSL support for both github.io subdomains and
custom domains, ensuring secure connections for your site visitors.</p>
