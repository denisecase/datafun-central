<h1 id="git">Git</h1>

<p>Git is a popular tool used to help collaborate with others and keep track of code changes over time.</p>
<p>At a high level, Git is a <strong>version control system</strong> for tracking changes in evolving code projects.
Using Git allows you to easily revert to an earlier version of code if you make a mistake or if a change causes unexpected problems.</p>
<p>Git makes it easy to collaborate with others on code.
You can use Git to share your code with others,
track changes that they make, and
merge their changes back into your codebase.
This makes it a great tool for open source development,
where many people may be working on the same codebase at the same time.</p>
<p>In this Git introduction, we&rsquo;ll start with the basics of using Git, including setting up your Git environment, creating a repository, and making commits. We&rsquo;ll also cover more advanced topics like branching, merging, and collaborating with others.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation process for Git depends on your operating system. Follow the instructions below based on your platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../tools/git/installation/">Git Installation</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-git">Using Git</h2>
<p>When it comes to using Git, you have a few options for how to interact with it. One option is to use Git in the terminal,
which involves typing out commands and working with the Git command line interface.
Another option is to use a Git integration in your Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>Using Git in the terminal can be a bit intimidating,
as it requires memorizing and typing out specific commands.
However, it can be a useful skill to have,
especially if you work on projects that require using Git outside of an IDE.</p>
<p>On the other hand,
using a Git integration in your IDE can make the process of working with Git more user-friendly and intuitive,
as you can often perform Git actions with a few clicks or keystrokes.
For example, Visual Studio Code has built-in Git support and provides a visual interface for common Git actions such as committing changes, creating branches, and merging changes.</p>

          <article class="default">
<h1 id="basics">Basics</h1>

<p>Git is a widely-used version control system that helps you track changes to your code and collaborate with others.
With Git, you can create a complete history of your work, from the initial commit to the latest changes. This makes it easy to work on a project with others, keep track of your progress, and recover from mistakes.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-repository">Creating a Repository</h2>
<p>To get started with Git, you need to create a repository.
This is where you&rsquo;ll store your code and track changes to it.
There are several ways to create a repository:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Clone an existing repository</strong>: If you want to work on code that&rsquo;s already been created and shared by someone else, you can clone their repository to your local machine. To do this, you&rsquo;ll need the repository&rsquo;s URL and you can use the <code>git clone</code> command to create a local copy of the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fork an existing repository</strong>: If you want to make changes to someone else&rsquo;s code and contribute those changes back to their repository, you can fork their repository. This creates a copy of their repository in your GitHub account, which you can then clone to your local machine and work on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a new repository</strong>: If you want to start a new project from scratch, you can create a new repository by clicking the &ldquo;+&rdquo; sign in the top right corner of your GitHub account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-code-onto-your-machine">Getting Code onto Your Machine</h2>
<p>Once you have a repository set up, you&rsquo;ll want to get the code onto your local machine so you can work on it.
To do this, clone the repository using the <code>git clone sourceurl</code> command. Change sourceurl to the address shown in the browser when viewing the root folder of the repository. This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine that you can work with.</p>
<h2 id="saving-changes-with-git">Saving Changes with Git</h2>
<p>Once you have a copy of the repository on your machine, you can make changes to the code and save those changes to the repository using Git. The basic workflow for this is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Add changes</strong>: Use the <code>git add .</code> command to add the changes you&rsquo;ve made to the code to the staging area. It&rsquo;s said &ldquo;git add dot&rdquo; - see the dot at the end - that means add all the newly created files into source control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commit changes</strong>: Use the <code>git commit -m &quot;add feature n</code> command to save the changes to the local repository with a descriptive commit message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Push changes</strong>: Use the <code>git push origin main</code> command to push the changes from your local repository back up to the remote repository on GitHub.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This sequence of commands is very common:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">git add .
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">git commit -m &#34;tell us what you did&#34;
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">git push origin main
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="editing-on-your-machine">Editing on your Machine</h2>
<p>We typically like to edit files on our machine using editors
like VS Code or IDEs like PyCharm and Spyder.
These local tools provide advanced features including syntax highlighting,
code completion, and debugging, which can make our work more efficient.</p>
<h2 id="editing-in-the-cloud">Editing in the Cloud</h2>
<p>However, the power of our local editors and IDEs is increasingly
becoming available in the cloud, and we can make many updates to
our repositories right from the GitHub web interface.
For example, you can use the github.dev web-based editor to
edit files and commit your changes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that if we edit files both on our machine
and in the cloud, we can end up with conflicts when trying to merge our changes.
Therefore, it&rsquo;s important to ensure that we always pull down the latest
changes from the cloud before making any local edits, and that we
push our changes back up to the cloud as soon as we&rsquo;re finished with them.</p>
<p>Using the git pull command will bring any changes made directly
in your GitHub (or other cloud) repository down to your machine.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">git pull
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Read more about the github.dev editor at:</p>

<li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor" target="_blank">https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="remotesremotesmd"><a href="../tools/git/basics/remotes.md">Remotes</a></h2>
<p>In Git, &ldquo;origin&rdquo; is a shorthand name that refers to the remote repository where your code is stored.
When you clone a repository,
Git automatically creates an &ldquo;origin&rdquo; remote that points to the original repository on the server.
You can use this remote to pull changes from the server or push your local changes back to it.</p>
<p>You can add more than one remote to a repository.</p>
<h2 id="branchesbranchesmd"><a href="../tools/git/basics/branches.md">Branches</a></h2>
<p>Git branches are separate lines of development that allow multiple
contributors to work on different features or versions of a project simultaneously.</p>
<p>The default branch in Git is now called &ldquo;main&rdquo;, but &ldquo;master&rdquo; was previously used,
so you may still see it.</p>
<h2 id="pull-and-push">Pull and Push</h2>
<p>When we use <code>git pull</code>,
Git already knows the source and destination of the changes (i.e.,
the remote and local repositories)
because it&rsquo;s been configured using the git clone command.</p>
<p>When we use <code>git push</code>, we need to specify both the remote repository
(the source) and the branch we want to push the changes to (the destination).
The origin in <code>git push origin main</code> refers to the remote repository we want
to push the changes to,
and main refers to the branch on the remote repository that we want to
update with our changes.</p>

<h1 id="branches">Branches</h1>

<p>In Git, we are always working on a <strong>branch</strong> of code,
which is like a separate &ldquo;timeline&rdquo; for the code.</p>
<h2 id="default-branch">Default Branch</h2>
<p>The default branch is employed automatically when we first create a repository,
and it is typically and by default named <strong>main</strong>. On older repos,
you may see a <em>master</em> branch instead, but the old terminology is
discouraged and easy to update.</p>
<h2 id="working-alone">Working Alone</h2>
<p>For independent projects, we may work directly on the main default branch.</p>
<p>Individual developers may choose to use branches to work on
new features or fixes without affecting their main codebase.</p>
<h2 id="working-together">Working Together</h2>
<p>In a professional environment, it&rsquo;s generally recommended to create
new branches for new features or changes to avoid conflicts with other
developers and to make it easier to manage and review changes.</p>
<p>Individual developers can also use branches to experiment with new features
or make changes without affecting the main codebase.</p>
<p>We can make changes, commit them to our branch, and then merge our
branch back into the default branch when appropriate.
Multiple branches allow a team to work on different features or changes
at once without worrying about conflicts or breaking the main codebase.</p>
<p>Once we&rsquo;re satisfied with our changes on a branch, we can create
a <strong>pull request</strong> to request that the changes be reviewed and
merged into the default branch. Team leads can then review and merge
the changes as needed. The default branch is typically set to &ldquo;main&rdquo;
and is the primary branch for the project.</p>
<p>You can create a new branch with the <code>git branch</code> command,
and switch to that branch with the <code>git checkout</code> command.
Once you&rsquo;re on the new branch, any changes you make and commit
will only affect that branch.</p>
<p>To merge a branch back into the main codebase, you can use
the <code>git merge</code> command. This will bring any changes from the
branch into the main codebase,
and you can resolve any conflicts that arise during the merge.</p>
<p>Git branches are an important tool for managing complex
projects with multiple contributors,
and they allow for efficient collaboration and code review.</p>

<h1 id="conflicts">Conflicts</h1>

<p>We can edit project files in at least two places:</p>
<ul>
<li>locally, on our machine</li>
<li>in the cloud, e.g., by using the editing features in GitHub</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bad-practices">Bad Practices</h2>
<p>We want to keep our local version and cloud version in sync at all times.</p>
<p>Some of the worst things we can do are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Forget to pull before we start our work.</li>
<li>Pull code and leave it for a long time, then start working on old, stale code.</li>
<li>Make huge, expansive contributions that take a long time (unless we know how to branch - an intermediate Git skill.)</li>
<li>Wait to push our completed changes to the cloud.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="good-practices">Good Practices</h2>
<p>To minimize the chance of conflits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Always pull code before you start working locally. Never work on stale code!</li>
<li>Make small, incremental changes.</li>
<li>As soon as you finish a useful contribution, git add, commit, and push up to the cloud.</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep your local and cloud repositories synchronized. Use these for each session.</p>
<p>Before you start:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">git pull
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After you finish a set of edits:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">git add .
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">git commit -m &#34;add title&#34;
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">git push
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When working collaboratively, communicate with team members and establish a clear workflow.
Ensure the team knows who is working on which files and when changes are being made.
You might create different small,
focused branches that don&rsquo;t overlap much in terms of the files they modify.</p>
<h2 id="merge-conflicts">Merge Conflicts</h2>
<p>Merge conflicts can occur when:</p>
<ul>
<li>two people edit the same file simultaneously</li>
<li>changes are made to a file both locally and in the cloud at the same time.</li>
<li>two branches with different changes are merged.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, we might use the GitHub cloud editor to make a quick
fix to our README.md - forgetting that we&rsquo;re also in the process of updating installation instructions on the local README.md.</p>
<p>Merge conflicts can be frustrating,
but they are an inevitable part of collaborative work.</p>
<p>If you do run into a merge conflict,
don&rsquo;t worry - it&rsquo;s not the end of
the world.
Git provides tools to help you resolve conflicts and merge
changes together.
The first step is to understand which files have
conflicts by running git status.
The files with conflicts will be
marked as &ldquo;unmerged&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To resolve the conflict,
open the conflicted file and look for the conflicting sections
marked with &laquo;&laquo;&laquo;&lt; HEAD, =======, and &raquo;&raquo;&raquo;&gt;.
Manually edit the file to remove the conflicting sections
and keep the changes you want.
Once you&rsquo;ve resolved the conflict,
fstage the changes with git add and commit them with git commit.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re still unsure how to resolve the conflict,
ask for help from your team members or consult Git documentation.
Stay calm and take your time to carefully resolve the conflict.</p>
<p>Experience managing merge conflicts can be very valuable.</p>

<h1 id="remotes">Remotes</h1>

<p>In Git, the term &ldquo;origin&rdquo; refers to the default remote repository that a local repository is linked to.
When you clone a repository from a remote server to your local machine,
Git automatically sets up the &ldquo;origin&rdquo; remote for you. This allows you to push changes from your local repository to the remote repository,
and pull changes from the remote repository to your local repository.</p>
<p>When you clone a repository,
Git sets up the origin remote by default,
pointing to the repository you cloned from.
This means that when you push changes to the remote repository,
they will be added to the branch on the remote repository that you cloned from.</p>
<p>Using the &ldquo;origin&rdquo; remote allows you to collaborate with others by sharing changes to the same repository.
When someone else pushes changes to the remote repository,
you can pull those changes down to your local repository
and merge them with your own changes.</p>
<p>However, if you edit the same file in
both your local repository and the remote repository,
conflicts can arise.
To avoid conflicts,
it&rsquo;s important to always pull down changes
from the remote repository
before making your own changes,
and to carefully review any merge conflicts that arise.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-remote-repositories">Working with Remote Repositories</h2>
<p>Git provides a set of commands that allow you to work with remote repositories. Here are some commonly used commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>git remote</code> - List the remote repositories that are connected to your local repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>git remote -v</code> - List the remote repositories along with their URLs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>git remote add &lt;name&gt; &lt;url&gt;</code> - Add a new remote repository to your local repository. The <code>name</code> parameter is the name you want to give the remote, and <code>url</code> is the URL of the remote repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>git remote rm &lt;name&gt;</code> - Remove a remote repository from your local repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>git push &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</code> - Push your local changes to a remote repository. The <code>remote</code> parameter is the name of the remote repository, and <code>branch</code> is the branch you want to push to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>git pull &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</code> - Pull changes from a remote repository into your local repository. The <code>remote</code> parameter is the name of the remote repository, and <code>branch</code> is the branch you want to pull from.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>git fetch &lt;remote&gt;</code> - Fetch the changes from a remote repository, but don&rsquo;t apply them to your local repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>git clone &lt;url&gt;</code> - Clone a remote repository to your local machine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="git-learning-concepts-over-memorization">Git Learning: Concepts Over Memorization</h2>
<p>Learning every Git command by heart is not necessary nor efficient.
Instead, focus on <strong>understanding</strong> the concepts and workflows of Git,
and how the commands fit into those workflows.
The vast amount of online resources available will serve as
reliable references when you need them.</p>
<p>As you work with Git more frequently,
the most common commands will become second nature.
However, for the rest, don&rsquo;t hesitate to look them up.
Remember that the value of Git lies not in memorizing commands
but in leveraging its powerful version control capabilities
to manage your projects effectively.</p>

<h1 id="vs-code">VS Code</h1>

<p>Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free and open-source code editor developed by Microsoft.
It is available on Windows, Linux, and macOS and offers features such as debugging, syntax highlighting, and intelligent code completion.</p>
<p>Some of the key features of VS Code include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built-in Git integration</li>
<li>Support for multiple languages and frameworks</li>
<li>Extensions for customizing the editor and adding new functionality</li>
<li>Debugging capabilities for Node.js, Python, and other languages</li>
<li>Integrated terminal for running commands and scripts</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a modern editor or IDE can make your coding experience more efficient and productive.</p>
<h2 id="why-vs-code">Why VS Code</h2>
<p>One reason we teach VS Code over Python-specific IDEs like Spyder and PyCharm is that VS Code is a more general-purpose code editor that supports multiple languages and workflows.
While Spyder and PyCharm are great for working with Python specifically,
VS Code is capable of handling a wider range of tasks and can be used for web development, data analysis, and more.</p>
<p>VS Code has a lot of built-in functionality for working with other languages commonly used in data analysis, including Markdown and SQL.
This makes it a great choice for someone who is just getting started with programming and data analysis and wants to learn a more versatile environment.</p>
<p>VS Code is widely used and well-supported, with many resources for learning how to use it effectively. In addition to the comprehensive official documenttaion, there are articles and videos available for begineers through experts.</p>

<h1 id="github">GitHub</h1>

<p>GitHub is a popular, web-based platform that allows data analysts and developers
to store and manage their code and collaborate with others.</p>
<p>GitHub is built on <a href="https://nwmissouri.instructure.com/courses/50814/pages/git" title="Git" target="_blank">Git</a>,
which is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes
to their code over time and collaborate with others on the same codebase.</p>
<p>With GitHub, developers can create their own <strong>repositories</strong>,
which are essentially <strong>folders</strong> that contain their code, documentation,
and other files related to a specific project. They can also <strong>fork</strong> other people&rsquo;s
repositories to create their own copies, which they can then modify and
contribute back to the original repository.
This allows for easy collaboration and code sharing among developers.</p>
<p>GitHub provides tools for developers to manage their code,
such as the ability to track and resolve issues,
review and merge pull requests, and create and manage branches.
It also provides a web-based interface for viewing and editing code,
as well as a built-in code editor.
Additionally, it has a wide range of integrations and APIs that allow developers
to automate various development tasks and integrate with other tools and services.</p>

<h2 id="github-repositories">GitHub Repositories</h2>
<p>Each coding project lives in a GitHub repository (called &lsquo;repo&rsquo; for short) in the &lsquo;cloud&rsquo; (a distributed group of machines).</p>
<p>Git (the system) keeps track of committed changes to an evolving project. <br>
- The GitHub repo can be kept in sync with a git repo on your local machine. <br>
- For example:<br>
    - If a GitHub repo is named <strong>datafun-01-getting-started</strong>. <br>
    - On my machine, it&rsquo;s in my <strong>Documents/datafun-01-getting-started</strong> directory.</p>

<p><em>At a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. To understand exactly what GitHub is, you need to know two connected principles: Version control, which helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code, and Git, which is a specific open-source version control system.</em></p>
